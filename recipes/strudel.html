        <h5>Steps</h5>
        <p>Follow along with these steps to make this yummy treat:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine warm water, honey, and yeast in a large bowl. Set aside to bloom.</li>
            <li>Dice cold butter into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Add flour to a large bowl and add the butter pieces.</li>
            <li>Mix together using a pastry knife or your hands, until the butter
                pieces are roughly the size of peas. 
            </li>
            <li>Add granulated sugar, eggs, and heavy cream to the yeast mixture. Mix well to combine.</li>
            <li>Add wet to dry and mix until a cohesive dough forms.</li>
            <li>Pour dough out onto a floured surface a knead to ensure the dough is totally cohesive.</li>
            <li>Divide into two. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 4-24 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove from the fridge and place dough onto a floured piece of parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Roll dough into a 14x14 square. Fold like an envelope, wrap and plastic wrap, and place back into the fridge. Repeat this process 3 more times.</li>
            <li>Remove dough from the refrigerator and roll into a 14x14 square. Cut off the four corners and then slice along two sides of the dough ever inch or so.</li>
            <li>Fill with optional jam and cream cheese.</li>
            <li>Fold and tuck the sliced pieces (kinda like a braid) to encase everything.</li>
            <li>Brush with egg wash. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise.</li>
            <li>While it's rising, preheat the oven to 400-degrees F.</li>
            <li>After the dough has risen, remove plastic wrap, and place into the preheated oven.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 minutes, or until dough is puffy and a deep golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li> While it's cooling, make the glaze by combining the heavy cream, powder sugar, and dash of vanilla. Whisk to combine until you have a drizzle consistency.</li>
            <li>Drizzle over the strudel. Slice, serve, and enjoy!</li>
