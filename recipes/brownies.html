            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350-degrees F. Meanwhile,
                    prepare your 8x8 (or 9x9) pan with parchment paper.
                </li>
                <li>Comine eggs, vanilla, sugar, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Combine cocoa and butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat.
                    Melt butter and whisk to combine.
                </li>
                <li>Add the warm cocoa mixture to the egg mixture. 
                    Do this slowly and whisk the <em>entire</em> time to 
                    ensure the eggs don't scramble.</li>
                    <li>Add the dry ingredients and mix well to combine.</li>
                    <li>Pour into prepared pan and bake for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove from oven and let cool. While the brownies cool,
                        let's make the glaze.
                    </li>
                    <li>Combine cocoa and butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat.
                        Whisk and cook until butter is melted and everything is combined.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the confectioners sugar. If the glaze becomes too thick, use water or milk to loosen as needed.</li>
                    <li>Slice the brownies, top with glaze, and serve. Yum!</li>
